## Stance Detection
The goal of the Fake News Challenge is to explore how artificial intelligence technologies, particularly machine learning and natural language processing, might be leveraged to combat the fake news problem Assessing the veracity of a news story is a complex and cumbersome task, even for trained experts. Fortunately, the process can be broken down into steps or stages A helpful first step towards identifying fake news is to understand what other news or-ganizations are saying about the topic We believe automating this process, called Stance Detection, could serve as a useful building block in an AI assisted fact checking pipeline So stage 1 of the Fake News Challenge (FNC 1) focuses on the task of Stance Detection. The baseline model achieved an accuracy score of 79.53% . With this baseline accuracy I went on try three simple classifiers and 4 recurrent neural networks. A simple lo-gistic regression classifier gave an accura-cy of 85.46% when ran on the unlabeled data. Considering this as my baseline model, I built two LSTMs, a unidirectional LSTM and a Bi directional LSTM. Each of the LSTM implemented in W2V ad GloVe gave higher accuracy scores than Logistic Regression. The Bi LSTM gave the highest accuracy of 92% among the other neural networks.
